			<h2>How to bridge the distance between business strategy and design</h2>
			<p>
				Strategy and creativity, in most companies, are separated by a mile-wide chasm. On one side are the strategists and marketing people who favour left-brain thinking - analyticsl, logical, linear, concrete, numerical, verbal. On the other side are the designers and creative people who favour right-brain thinking - intuitive, emotional, sparial, visual, physical.
			</p>
			<p>
				Unfortunately, the left braind doesn't always know what the right brain is doing. Whenever there's a rift between strategy and creativity - between logic and magic-there's a brand gap. It can cause a brilliant strategy and to fail where it counts most, at the point of contact with the customer, or it can doom a bold creative initiative before it's even launched, way back at the planning stage. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The gulf between strategy and creativity can divide a company from its customers so completely that no significant communication passes between them. For the customer, it can be like trying to listen to a state-of-the-art radio through incompatible speakers: The signal comes in strong, but the sounds are unintelligible.

				Does the left brain know what the right brain is doing?

				Introducing the charismatic brand

				There are two ways to look at the brand gap:
				<ul>
					<li>It creates a natural barrier to comunication, and</li>
					<li>It creates a natural barrier to competition.</li>
				</ul>

				This is Herman Brooks. Herman is just like the rest of us. Everyday he has to make all kinds of decisions like what to wear, whom to date and when to panic. Now these decisions should be easy but if you take a look inside Herman's head, you'll see why he sometimes has trouble making up his mind. Sometimes they agree... usually they don't. But the struggle is going on inside all of us and it's all going on inside Herman's head.
